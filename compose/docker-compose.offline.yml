  prompt: Enable OFFLINE MODE, only for when running videos using the "Offline Processing"?
  description:
    The default mode is ONLINE. It is to be used for client sites where the autodelete feature
    must be enabled to manage storage constraints.
    OFFLINE MODE is to be used when running videos using the Offline Processing
    tool. This disabled the autodelete feature, so data persists in the dbserver.

  dbserver:
    environment:
